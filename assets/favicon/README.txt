To add the Aleri Stream logo as a favicon:

1. Save the blue Aleri Stream logo image you shared in the chat
2. Convert it to favicon formats - you can use online tools like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
3. Place all generated favicon files in this folder
4. The HTML code has been updated to reference these favicon files

For best compatibility across all browsers and devices, it's recommended to generate multiple sizes of the favicon.
